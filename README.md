# Web-based Password Generator
This is a simple web-based password generator which uses 9-different styles
of passwords that can fit personal preferences, or restrictions from
websites that require the password in a certain format.

Everything is calculated in JavaScript locally, and the passwords are not
sent to the server for logging. You should be able to download this code,
and run it offline, if you're truly paranoid.
